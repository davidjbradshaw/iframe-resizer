## Upgrading to version 4

In version 4 support for IE 8-10 and Andriod 4.4 has been removed, if you still need this then please use version 3 of this library.

The callback methods have been renamed to onEvents, so for example `scrollCallback` is now called `onScroll`. This is to enable better integration with modern libraries such as React.
