# iFrame Resizer [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer)

This library enables the resizing of both same and cross domain iFrames to fit the contained content. It uses [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.postMessage) to pass messages between the host page and the iFrame and when available [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) to detect DOM changes, with a fall back to setInterval for IE8-10. The code also detects resize events and provides functions to allow the iFrame to set a custom size.

The package contains two minified JavaScript files in the [js](js) folder. The first ([iframeResizer.min.js](https://raw2.github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer/master/js/iframeResizer.min.js)) is for the page hosting the iFrames. It can be called with **native** JavaScript;

```js
iFrameResize([{options}],[selector]);
```

or via **jQuery**.

```js
$('iframe').iFrameResize([{options}]);
```

The second file ([iframeResizer.contentWindow.min.js](https://raw.github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer/master/js/iframeResizer.contentWindow.min.js)) is a **native** JavaScript file that needs placing in the page contained within your iFrame. <i>This file is designed to be a guest on someone else's system, so has no dependancies and won't do anything until it's activated by a message from the containing page</i>.

### Typical setup

The normal configuration is to have the iFrame resize when the browser window changes size or the content of the iFrame changes. To set this up you need to configure one of the dimensions of the iFrame to a percentage and tell the library only to update the other dimension. Normally you would set the width to 100% and have the height scale to fit the content.

```html
<iframe src="http://anotherdomain.com/frame.content.html" width="100%" scrolling="no"></iframe>
```

Note that scrolling is set to 'no', as older versions of IE don't allow this to be turned off in code and can just slightly add a bit of extra space to the bottom of the content that it doesn't report when it returns the height.

Then we initialise the library on the page hosting our iFrame. This example shows all the default options and the values returned to the callback function.

```js
iFrameResize({
	log                     : false,
	autoResize              : true,
	contentWindowBodyMargin : 8,
	sizeHeight              : true,
	sizeWidth               : false,
	enablePublicMethods     : false,
	interval                : 32,
	scrolling               : false,
	callback                : function(messageData){
		$('p#callback').html('<b>Frame ID:</b> '   + messageData.iframe.id + 
							' <b>Height:</b> '     + messageData.height + 
							' <b>Width:</b> '      + messageData.width +
							' <b>Event type:</b> ' + messageData.type
		);
	}
});
```

###Example
To see this working take a look at this [example](http://davidjbradshaw.com/iframe-resizer/example/) and watch the console log.

## Options

### log

	default: false
	type: boolean

Setting the `log` option to true will make the scripts in both the host page and the iFrame output everything they do to the JavaScript console so you can see the communication between the two scripts.

### autoResize

	default: true
	type: boolean

When enabled changes to the Window size or the DOM will cause the iFrame to resize to the new content size. Disable if using size method with custom dimensions.

### contentWindowBodyMagin

	default: 8  (in px)
	type: number

Setting is used to override the default browser body tag style. As we cannot reliably read this value and it's not included in the figure returned by `document.body.offsetHeight`. So the only way to reliably work out this value is to set it. 

The default value of 8px is the preset value in FireFox; however, you will most likely want to set this to zero so that the content of you iFrame is at the edge of the iFrame.

### sizeHeight

	default: true
	type: boolean

Resize iFrame to content height.

### sizeWidth

	default: false
	type: boolean

Resize iFrame to content width.

### enablePublicMethods  

	default: false
	type: boolean

If enabled, a `window.parentIFrame` object is created in the iFrame. This contains `size()` and `close()` methods.

### interval

	default: 32  (in ms)
	type: number

In browsers that don't support [mutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver), such as IE10, the library falls back to using setInterval, to check for changes to the page size. The default value is equal to two frame refreshes at 60Hz, setting this to a higher value will make screen redraws noticeable to the user.

Setting this property to a negative number will force the interval check to run instead of [mutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver).

Set to zero to disable.

### scrolling

    default: false
    type: boolean

Enable scroll bars in iFrame.

### callback

	type: function ({iframe,height,width,type})
	
Function called after iFrame resized. Passes in messageData object containing the **iFrame**, **height**, **width** and the **type** of event that triggered the iFrame to resize.


## IFrame Methods

To enable these methods you must set `enablePublicMethods` to `true`. This creates the `window.parentIFrame` object in the iFrame.

##### window.parentIFrame.close()

Calling this function causes the parent page to remove the iFrame. This method should be contained in the following rapper, in case the page is not loaded inside an iFrame.

```js
if ('parentIFrame' in window) {
	window.parentIFrame.close();
}
```

##### window.parentIFrame.size ([customHeight],[ customWidth])

Manually force iFrame to resize. In case the page is loaded outside the iFrame, you should test before making this call.

```js
if ('parentIFrame' in window) {
	window.parentIFrame.size();
}
```

This method also accepts two arguments: **customHeight** & **customWidth**. To use them you need first to disable the autoResize option to prevent auto resizing and enable the sizeWidth option if you wish to set the width.

```js
iFrameResize({
	autoResize: false,
	enablePublicMethods: true,
	sizeWidth: true
});
```

Then just call size method with dimensions:

```js
if ('parentIFrame' in window) {
	window.parentIFrame.size(100); // Set height to 100px
}
```


## Browser compatibility 
###jQuery version

Works with all browsers which support [window.postMessage](http://caniuse.com/#feat=x-doc-messaging) (IE8+).

###Native version

Additionally requires support for [Array.prototype.forEach](http://kangax.github.io/es5-compat-table/#Array.prototype.forEach) (IE9+) and [document.querySelectorAll](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document.querySelectorAll) (IE8 Standards Mode). For IE8 use the [MDN PolyFil](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) and force [Standards Mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_8#Standards_mode) with the following meta tag.

```html
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
```
## Bower

This library can be installed via the [Bower](http://bower.io) front-end package management system.

    bower install iframe-resizer


##Changes between version 1 and 2.

Version 2 makes a few changes that you need to be aware of when upgrading. The filename of the host page script has been renamed from jquery.iframeResizer.min.js to iframeResizer.min.js in order to reflect that jQuery is now an optional way of calling the script. The do(Heigh/Width) options have been renamed size(Height/Width). 

The method names deprecated in version 1.3.0 have now been removed. Versions 1 and 2 remain compatable with each other so you can use version 2 of the hostpage script with an iFrame running version 1 of the iFrame script, or <i>vice versa</i>.

##Version History
* v2.0.0 Added native JS public function, renamed script filename to reflect that jQuery is now optional, renamed do(Heigh/Width) to size(Height/Width). Improved logging messages. Stop resize event firing for 50ms after interval event. Added multiple page example. Removed deprecated methods.
* v1.4.4 Fixed bodyMargin bug.
* v1.4.3 CodeCoverage fixes. Documentation improvements.
* v1.4.2 Fixed size(250) example in IE8.
