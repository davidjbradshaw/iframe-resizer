      <p>
        But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
        pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
        account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
        explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
        rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
        but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
        encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
        anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because
        it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil
        and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
        which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to
        obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with
        a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
        or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike
        men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
        moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
        trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who
        fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying
        through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple
        and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is
        untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like
        best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in
        certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations
        of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be
        repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds
        in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to
        secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse
        pains.
