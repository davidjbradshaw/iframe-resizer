		But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will
		give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
		master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but
		because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
		Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because
		occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
		example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who
		has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who
		avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
	</p>

		On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the
		charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound
		to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as
		saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free
		hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best,
		every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty
		or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.
		The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure
		other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
